# FreeRTOS Projects SRC Repository

This repository contains the source code for various FreeRTOS-based projects. Each project demonstrates different aspects of real-time operating system (RTOS) programming and embedded systems development.

## Projects Included

1. **Interfacing with Various Peripherals**  
   - Demonstrates interfacing FreeRTOS with different hardware peripherals such as LEDs, buttons, and sensors from the Zybo Z7 FPGA.

2. **UART + Interrupt Serviced Requests**  
   - Implements UART communication using a combination of interrupt-driven mechanisms and polling to handle data transmission and reception.

3. **Integrating SPI Communications**  
   - Explores SPI protocol integration in FreeRTOS for high-speed communication between microcontrollers and peripherals.
